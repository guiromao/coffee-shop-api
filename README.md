## Coffee Shop API

Implementation for receiving a user location (Coordinate: latitude and longitude), and also provided a maximum walking distance (in metres), a list of the 
nearest 
coffee shops is displayed. These are ordered from nearest to less near.

Please run the program and:
1) Input latitude + longitude (two double values separated by a space character)
2) Input the maximum walking distance you're willing to go, as a user (in metres)
3) Get the coffee shop locations that match your criteria

Note: due to the distances in metres being easily scaled, my suggestion is that both latitude and longitude are provided as low values, such as 0.0003

On the other hand, naturally increased walking distances will provide more results (example: 5000).
