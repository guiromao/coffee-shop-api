## Coffee Shop API

Implementation for providing a list of near coffee shops based on the user location (Coordinate: latitude and longitude). These will also be ordered from 
nearest to less near.
The FindService class contains the logic to obtain and sort the coffee shops, according to the obtained location.

Please run the program and:
1) Input latitude + longitude (two double values separated by a space character)
2) Get the coffee shop locations that match your criteria

Note: due to the distances in metres being easily scaled, my suggestion is that both latitude and longitude are provided as low values, such as 0.0003
