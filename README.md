## Coffee Shop API

Implementation for providing a list of near coffee shops based on the user location (Coordinate: latitude and longitude). These will also be ordered from 
nearest to less near.

Please run the program and:
1) Input latitude + longitude (two double values separated by a space character)
2) Get the coffee shop locations that match your criteria

Note: due to the distances in metres being easily scaled, my suggestion is that both latitude and longitude are provided as low values, such as 0.0003
