## Coffee Shop API

Implementation for receiving a user location (Coordinate: latitude and longitude), and also provided a maximum walking distance (in metres), a list of the 
nearest 
coffee shops is displayed. These are ordered from nearest to less near.

Please run the program and:
1) Input latitude + longitude (two double values separated by a space character)
2) Get the coffee shop locations that match your criteria

Note: due to the distances in metres being easily scaled, my suggestion is that both latitude and longitude are provided as low values, such as 0.0003
